Data Analysis of Uber Demand and Supply Gaps

Data Cleaning & Wrangling: Handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Extracting time-based features like hour, day, and time category.

Visual Analysis: Column charts, pie charts, grouped bar charts, and heatmaps to highlight demand patterns and gaps.

Insights: Peak hours (morning/evening) and locations like airports show the highest unmet demand. Cancellations and “No Cars Available” contribute significantly to lost revenue.

Business Recommendations:

Dynamic driver allocation during peak hours and high-demand zones.

Incentives and surge pricing to encourage driver availability.

Monitoring cancellations and improving operational efficiency to reduce demand gaps.

Outcome: Implementing these data-driven strategies can increase ride completion, improve customer satisfaction, optimize driver utilization, and boost revenue, supporting sustainable business growth.
